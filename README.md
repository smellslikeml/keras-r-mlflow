# Training Keras with MLflow and R

This repo provides notebook examples training a GLM model with Keras using R. It includes a notebook example that loads the R model as a Python model to register and serve using MLflow.

To use these examples, please clone into your workspace using the [repos](https://docs.databricks.com/repos/index.html) functionality on Databricks.

This example was run using a [10.4 ML LTS Runtime](https://docs.databricks.com/release-notes/runtime/10.4ml.html) on Databricks.
